🔐 Caesar Cipher - Python
A simple Python program to encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher as part of my 100 Days of Python learning journey.

📜 What is Caesar Cipher?
The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in a text is shifted by a fixed number of places down the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 3:

a becomes d

b becomes e

x becomes a (wraps around)

🚀 Features
✅ Encrypts (encode) plain text with a shift value.
✅ Decrypts (decode) encrypted text with the same shift value.
✅ Allows repeated encoding/decoding until you choose to stop.
✅ Uses Python lists and loops for implementation.

🛠 Requirements
Python 3

No external packages are required.

💻 How to Use
1️⃣ Clone or download this repository.

2️⃣ Run the program:
python ceaser_cipher.py
3️⃣ Follow the prompt:

Type encode to encrypt a message.

Type decode to decrypt a message.

Enter the message and the shift value.

Type stop when you want to exit.
